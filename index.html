                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

            " Before joining the bootcamp. I've
            never written a line of code. I needed
            some structure from professionals
            who can help me learn programming
            step by step. I was encouraged to
            enroll by a former student of theirs
            who can only say wonderful things
            about the program. The entire
            curriculum and staff did not
            disappoint. They were very hands-on
            and I never had to wait long for
            assitance. The agile team project, in
            particular, was outstanding. It took
            my learning to the next level in a way
            that no tutorial could ever have. In
            fact, I've often referred to it during
            interviews as an example of my
            development experience. It certainly
            helped me land a job as full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple
            offers. 100% recommended! "
